AED suite is a collection of community-driven libraries of modules and
algorithms for simulation of "aquatic ecodynamics" - water quality, aquatic
biogeochemsitry, biotic habitat and aquatic ecosystem dynamics.

libaed-water is the core library of water biochemistry modules
libaed-bentic is a collection of benthic layer modules
libaed-demo is a set of examples for developing modules

Each module aims to be based on state-of-the-art science sourced from a wide
variety of scientific literature, making the library one of the most
advanced available to aquatic ecosystem modellers.
